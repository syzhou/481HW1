[How to play] 
This is a guessing number game on Android platform. The system generates a four-digit number with each digit different from the others. A user plays the game by typing a number and touch "Guess". The text area will then print how many digits the user got in the right position and right number(represented as A) and how many digits the user got in the wrong position but right number(represented as B). The player makes full use of the feedbacks to guess the correct number with the minimum guesses. The player can touch restart to play a new game.
For example, if the system generated number is "1234", the user guesses "3456", he gets 0A2B. Then the user guesses "1256", he gets 2A0B. Finally he typed "1234" and he won the game.

[To run the code]
Use Eclipse Android development platform. 
Plug in an Android device to PC, select Run-> Run.

If you don't have an Android device, select Windows->Android Virtual Device Manager to create a virtual device, then select Run-> Run. Note that the Android virtual device can be incredibly slow.

I used the a Sumsang Galaxy S3 smart phone to debug and test my code. So the screenshots are all from the Android device.
